# Rich Communication to replace Short Message services
### By Gordon Gottsegen

The [article](https://www.cnet.com/news/google-fi-texts-will-be-more-like-imessage-thanks-to-rcs-upgrade/)
by Gottsegen describes the possibility of replacing old services boggling down the experience of cellphone users.
So, instead of expecting users from different devices to use cross-platform messaging apps,
_Google_ is trying to rally manufacturers and cellphone service providers to agree on
a standard messaging protocol. The legacy **Short Message Service** (SMS) protocol has hit
the ceiling of modern demands. **Rich Communication Services** (RCS) extends the limitations
SMS cannot exceed. Soon patrons of both tech giants, _Apple_ and _Google_, will enrich the
sharing of modern media across platforms.

>> "Rich Communication Services is what lets you use read receipts in texts or see when someone else is typing" (Gottsegen).
